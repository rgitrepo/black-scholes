# Black-Scholes-Merton Model for Option Pricing
Black-Scholes-Merton model implementation in Python

This model calculates the theoretical value of an option based on five parameters:

- **Underlying Price (S):** The current market price of the asset.

- **Strike Price (K)**: The predetermined price at which the option can be exercised.

- **Time to Expiration (T):**  The time left (in years) until the option’s expiration date.

- **Risk Free Rate (r):** The constant rate of return on a risk-free asset, such as a government bond.

- **Volatility (σ):** A measure of how much the price of the underlying asset fluctuates.

Here we use this model to calcuate the theoretical values of both Call and Put options using Python.
